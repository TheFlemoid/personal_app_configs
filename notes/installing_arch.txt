# Installing Arch on the MSI GF62

- Basic installation following the Arch Wiki was fairly straight forward, and was able to get a system up and running with KDE Plasma without too much trouble.
- Installing the nVidia drivers for the onboard GTX 1050TI-M was a little strange.  Installed `nvidia-lts` and `nvidia-utils` as suggested [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA), but I still could not get the nouveau drivers to not load.  The trick ended up being blacklisting nouveau in the grub config, similar to how it is on other systems.  I added `modprobe.blacklist=nouveau` to the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` line in `/etc/default/grub`, and then ran `grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`, and then rebooted to load Linux with the new grub.  This ended up working (not sure if any troubleshooting before that had an impact on the problem, I also rebuilt the initramfs with `kms` removed from the `HOOKS`, but that did not appear to have any impact.
- I have not gotten NVENC or NVDEC to work (ie `nvcodec` plugin children) to work in gstreamer.  When inspecting the nvcodec plugin, it complains that `libcuda.so.1` could not be found, however I have the library in `/usr/lib` after installing the `nvidia-utils`, `cuda`, and `cuda-tools` packages.
